# BluePilot fork — working notes

## START HERE if the owner asks to update

They will open a fresh session and say something like *"update BluePilot"*, *"get the latest
version"*, or *"there's a new BluePilot"*. That is the whole request. Handle it end to end:

```bash
python tools/bp_merge_upstream.py
```

Then:

1. **No conflicts, tests green** → show them the summary, commit, push, and give them the
   copy-pasteable device command below. Done.
2. **Conflicts** → resolve them yourself. The script prints what *ours* is in each file. Keep our
   change, re-apply theirs around it, `git add`, re-run the script. Then as above.
3. **Tests fail** → say so plainly and do not tell them it is safe to flash. Diagnose it.

Then give them exactly this, and nothing more complicated:

```bash
cd /data/openpilot && git pull && sudo reboot
```

**Rules for this task, learned the hard way:**

- **Never ask them a git question.** Not merge vs rebase, not how to resolve a conflict, not which
  branch. They have said plainly they do not want git terminology. Decide and proceed.
- **Never report it as safe to flash with a failing test.** A dismissed test is how a duplicate CAN
  registration reached the car and stranded it on "waiting to start".
- After resolving anything in `controller.py`, re-read **The ICBM button contract** further down and
  check the resolution against it. Tests cannot catch a merge that quietly changes what a cruise
  button means.
- If something goes badly wrong, the script printed a rollback tag: `git reset --hard <tag>`.

Everything below is background for when that is not enough.

## Run tests with `tools/bp_offline_test.py`, never bare `pytest`

```bash
python tools/bp_offline_test.py                      # the offline-testable suite
python tools/bp_offline_test.py path/to/test_x.py    # anything pytest accepts
```

Bare `pytest` does not work here and, worse, **fails in ways that look like environment noise**:

- **Wrong interpreter.** `pyproject.toml` pins `>= 3.12.3, < 3.13`. On Python 3.14, PEP 649 makes
  class annotations lazy, so opendbc's `auto_dataclass` — which reads
  `cls.__dict__['__annotations__']` — sees nothing and converts no fields. Every `auto_field()`
  default stays a raw sentinel `object` instead of becoming an `int`/`bool`/`str`. Tests then fail
  with things like `unsupported operand type(s) for |=: 'object' and 'int'` that cannot happen on
  the device. The runner re-execs itself under 3.12, so it works whatever Python you invoke it with.
- **Missing compiled extensions.** `common/params_pyx` is a Cython module built by scons, and the
  repo `conftest.py` imports `Params` at collection time, so nothing collects without it. The
  runner stubs `Params` and the other device-only leaves and passes `--noconftest`.

The bar is **0 failures**, not a particular total — the count moves with the branch and with what
is in `DEFAULT_TARGETS`, so a hardcoded number here just goes stale and stops being checked.

Do not learn to ignore a failure. Three were dismissed as "pre-existing stub artifacts" across two
sessions, and that habit is what let a startup crash reach the car. Diagnose it, or say plainly
that it is unexplained — never report a branch as safe to flash with a red test in it.

Environment (already set up): `../.venv-bp312`, a 3.12.13 venv. Recreate with:

```bash
uv python install 3.12
uv venv --python 3.12 ../.venv-bp312
uv pip install --python ../.venv-bp312/Scripts/python.exe pytest pytest-mock pycapnp numpy zstandard requests tqdm crcmod-plus sympy pyserial raylib ruff pycryptodome sentry-sdk
```

## What offline tests do NOT cover

Anything needing compiled extensions, a real CAN bus, or a display. Two specific gaps have bitten:

- **`get_can_parsers`.** `CANParser` rejects a duplicate message address with
  `RuntimeError("Duplicate Message Check: N")` at car init, which kills `card` and leaves the
  device on "waiting to start". This happened for real when an upstream merge added a second
  `Traffic_RecognitnData` registration. `test_can_parser_messages.py` now stubs `CANParser`/`DBC`
  and asserts on the argument lists across all flag combinations. **Anything that builds a parser
  or runs at car init needs a test of this shape** — the behavioral suite never reaches it.
- **Settings screens rendering.** Structure and names can be checked statically (see below), but
  nothing renders them offline.

Onroad HUD drawing *is* checkable, and the check is **trustworthy**:
`selfdrive/ui/bp/onroad/tools/preview_acc_status.py` renders the shipped drawing methods to PNG at
device scale. The owner confirmed on 2026-08-03, after driving it, that the car looks *exactly*
like the preview renders -- colors, sizes, spacing, all of it.

So treat a preview render as the answer, not an approximation. Iterate on it until it looks right
and ship that; do not caveat UI work with "we won't know until you drive it", and do not ask the
owner to judge a layout you have not rendered. It calls the real drawing methods out of
hud_renderer_bp.py rather than reimplementing them, which is why it stays accurate -- keep it that
way, and add a scene to SCENES whenever a new state is introduced.

## Before saying a branch is safe to flash

1. `python tools/bp_offline_test.py` — expect 0 failed.
2. `ruff check --isolated --select F821,F811,F401,F841 <changed .py files>` — F821 (undefined name)
   is the one that matters; it catches what import tests cannot reach. Compare any finding against
   the merge base before treating it as yours.
3. For changes under `opendbc/car/` or anything in `card`: confirm nothing new is constructed at
   car init without a test, and that every CAN signal read exists in the DBC.
4. For new `Params` keys: confirm each is declared in `common/params_keys.h`. The stubbed `Params`
   raises on unknown keys the way the device does.

## Do not fix UNRELATED upstream bugs in this fork

**The test, stated by the owner on 2026-08-08: does this change what MY CAR does, what I SEE, or
whether I can TAKE THE NEXT BluePilot?** Not "is it a real bug", and not "is this file ours". If the
answer is no, report it upstream and leave it.

**Staying upgradable outranks being right elsewhere.** Every upstream line this fork modifies is a
merge conflict paid on every future update, forever. An update that feels like a chore is an update
that gets deferred, and falling behind upstream costs more than any individual bug being correct.

A worked set, from the branch review on 2026-08-08 where all four were proposed together:

| Proposed | Verdict | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_bp_device_mount` naming a `Device` member upstream deleted | **take** | AttributeError broke `car_list.json` generation, which `bp_merge_upstream.py` runs on every update -- it broke the upgrade path itself |
| `FORD_FUSION_MK5` docs name parsing to no years | **take** | his car, unsearchable in his own vehicle picker |
| `FORD_MONDEO_MK5` year format, same root cause | **drop** | not his car |
| `IcbmResumeMinLeadSpeed` label showing km/h while the code uses `MPH_TO_MS` | **drop** | real, and ours by file -- but he is not metric, so it cannot affect his car |

The last row is the one to internalize: **ours-by-file is not enough on its own.**

This is a personal fork of BluePilot, which forks sunnypilot, which forks openpilot. A bug that
belongs to one of those layers, and has nothing to do with the work here, should be **reported
there, not patched here**.

Every upstream line this fork modifies is a merge conflict paid for on every future rebase, forever.
That is worth it for something this car needs and free-riding on someone else's maintenance for
anything else.

**ICBM is the exception, and it is a broad one.** Anything touching Intelligent Cruise Button
Management is in scope whatever layer owns the file, bug or feature, without asking. ICBM itself
lives under `sunnypilot/`, most of what it reads is sunnypilot's, and the whole point of this fork
is making it work properly on this car -- so "that is upstream's file" is not a reason to leave ICBM
behavior broken. The same goes for anything ICBM depends on: `cruise_ext.py`'s button timers feed
the press stand-down, so they are ICBM's business too.

The rule is about bugs that are *not ours*. A boot-splash warning is not ours. ICBM always is.

Layers, outermost first — check which one a file belongs to before editing it:

| Path | Owner |
|---|---|
| `selfdrive/ui/bp/`, `bluepilot/`, `launch_chffrplus.sh`, `scripts/boot_logo.sh` | BluePilot |
| `sunnypilot/`, `opendbc/sunnypilot/`, `selfdrive/ui/sunnypilot/` | sunnypilot |
| everything else | openpilot / opendbc |

**Legitimate reasons to touch an upstream file:**

- a new `Params` key (`common/params_keys.h`), capnp field (`cereal/custom.capnp`) or its dataclass
  mirror (`opendbc/car/structs.py`) that this fork's features need
- this car's platform: `opendbc/car/ford/values.py`, `torque_data/override.toml`, fingerprints
- anything ICBM-related at all -- see above, no justification needed
- a bug that is genuinely load-bearing for other work here
- something the owner explicitly asked for, e.g. the Sentry opt-in guard in `system/sentry.py`
- new test files, which are additive and never conflict

**Not legitimate**, and the case that prompted this rule: on 2026-08-03 a PWD/`$(pwd)` inconsistency
in `launch_chffrplus.sh` was fixed here because it printed a warning on the boot splash. Correct
fix, wrong repo — a cosmetic message, in a boot-critical file that cannot be tested offline, with no
connection to this car. Reverted. If something like that is worth fixing, send it upstream.

When in doubt, ask rather than fix. Reordering upstream's own UI items counts too, even though it
looks harmless.

## Merging a newer BluePilot

**Do not ask the owner to choose between merge and rebase, or any other git decision.** They have
said plainly they do not want to deal with git terminology -- they ask for "the latest BluePilot"
and expect it handled. Default to merge, which is the easier path for a fork carrying this many
commits, and only use `--rebase` if they specifically ask for it by name.

Staying current matters more than any individual change here — an update that looks like a chore is
an update that gets deferred. So it is one command:

```bash
python tools/bp_merge_upstream.py               # merge upstream/bp-7.0
python tools/bp_merge_upstream.py --dry-run     # what would come in, changes nothing
```

It tags a rollback point first, refuses to start on a dirty tree, regenerates `car_list.json`
instead of merging it, prints what *ours* is in each remaining conflict, runs the test suite, and
stops without committing or pushing. Resolve conflicts, `git add`, re-run it to finish the checks.

**`car_list.json` is generated — never hand-merge it**, which is why the script handles it. It is
the largest conflict surface in the fork by an order of magnitude (~420 lines rewritten, because
adding one platform re-sorts the whole file). By hand, if ever needed:

```bash
git checkout --theirs opendbc_repo/opendbc/sunnypilot/car/car_list.json
python opendbc_repo/opendbc/sunnypilot/car/platform_list.py
```

Everything else, ranked by how often upstream touches it — the top of this list is where conflicts
will actually land, and what our change is in each so it can be preserved rather than rediscovered:

| File | Upstream commits/yr | What is ours |
|---|---|---|
| `selfdrive/ui/bp/layouts/settings/bluepilot.py` | ~47 | pinion-yaw toggle gated on the `ALT_STEER_ANGLE` flag, not a platform name; ACC status toggle wording |
| `opendbc/car/ford/carcontroller.py` | ~34 | 3 lines: the standstill resume gate |
| `sunnypilot/.../intelligent_cruise_button_management/controller.py` | ~16 | all of it — this is the fork's core work |
| `sunnypilot/sunnylink/settings_ui.json` | ~18 | our settings entries |
| `sunnypilot/.../speed_limit/speed_limit_assist.py` | ~12 | SLA hooks |
| `sunnypilot/.../longitudinal_planner.py` | ~13 | unconfirmed-lead plumbing |
| `opendbc/car/ford/carstate.py` | ~10 | TSR flag gating + `Traffic_RecognitnData` registration |
| `opendbc/sunnypilot/car/ford/carstate_ext.py` | ~8 | TSR parsing, brake-light status |
| `selfdrive/ui/bp/onroad/hud_renderer_bp.py` | ~10 | HOLD / ACC / lamp readouts — almost purely additive |

Everything not listed is either a new file (never conflicts) or a pure addition.

**After any merge, before flashing**, in this order — the first two exist specifically because an
upstream merge broke them before:

1. `python tools/bp_offline_test.py` — 0 failures.
   - `test_structs_capnp_parity` catches a capnp field added without its dataclass mirror, which
     crashed `card` at startup once.
   - `test_can_parser_messages` catches a duplicate CAN registration, which stranded the car on
     "waiting to start" after upstream added a second `Traffic_RecognitnData`.
2. `ruff check --isolated --select F821,F811,F401,F841 <changed .py>` — compare findings against the
   merge base before assuming they are yours.
3. Re-read any conflict resolution in `controller.py` against **The ICBM button contract** below.
   A merge that silently changes what a button means is the worst outcome here, and the tests will
   not catch it if the resolution is internally consistent.

If it goes wrong: `git reset --hard pre-upstream-<sha>`.

## Name a feature for what it DOES, never for ICBM

ICBM is an **actuator adapter**, not a feature. It exists because stock Ford ACC will not take a
longitudinal command, so the planner's desired speed has to be translated into cruise-button
presses.

**openpilot alpha long is unusable on Ford** -- the owner has tried it and calls it absolute
trash. Do not suggest flipping the toggle to compare them, and do not use "op long is coming" to
justify sequencing anything. He has no idea when it will be good and neither does anyone else.

The toggle does exist: `interfaces_ext.py` forces `alphaLongitudinalAvailable = True` on every Ford
and makes it authoritative -- `openpilotLongitudinalControl = bool(alpha_long)`, with
`intelligentCruiseButtonManagementAvailable` True for the case where it is off. Worth knowing when
reasoning about which code path runs; not a recommendation.

So ICBM is the long-term path on this car, which makes this naming rule MORE important, not less:
anything durable has to outlive an ICBM era measured in years.

So `Icbm*` is reserved for things that are meaningless when the toggle is on: button injection and the button contract, the
target drop/rise limiters (they only exist to make Ford coast instead of brake), the custom
press increments, the standstill resume gate, the 20 mph floor, the radar-blind lead detector and
the model-stop path. Every one of those solves a problem that disappears.

**Anything meant to outlive that gets its own name.** `SpeedLimit*`, `SmartCruiseControl*`,
`PassingAssist*` are right: they say what the feature is. A radar-detector integration is a
`RadarDetector*` thing — it has nothing to do with cruise buttons and must keep working when they
are gone. Naming it `Icbm*` files a durable feature under the scaffolding and guarantees it gets
deleted with it, or kept for the wrong reason.

The line to apply: **would this still make sense if openpilot were driving the car directly?** If
yes, it is not an ICBM feature, whatever module it currently lives in.

**Known violations, deliberately left alone for now.** `IcbmPinnedHolds*` and
`IcbmBaselineResetDelta` are the HOLD concept, which is a planner idea that happens to live in the
button layer — "aim at my number instead of the posted limit, and keep everything else working
against it" needs no buttons at all. They are misnamed. Renaming a `PERSISTENT` key discards its
stored value, so this waits until holds actually move into the planner, and is done through the
`_BP_LATERAL_SCHEME_PARAM_RENAMES` machinery in `params_migration.py` that already exists for
exactly this.

**A new prefix has a second obligation.** `_BP_TRACKED_PREFIXES` in `sunnypilot/system/params_migration.py`
lists the prefixes whose shipped defaults can reach the car. A key outside it never receives a
changed default and nothing says so — that already happened to seven `PassingAssist*` keys. Add the
prefix in the same commit that introduces it.

## The ICBM button contract

Settled on the road, 2026-08-03. Do not change these meanings without asking — they are muscle
memory now, and the owner has already relearned them once.

A HOLD is the driver's own set speed. While one is held every other ICBM feature keeps working
against it: curves still slow the car, the hazard path still fires, and the speed returns to the
driver's number afterwards rather than to the speed limit.

| Key on the wheel | Cruise engaged | Cruise off |
|---|---|---|
| `RES +` (`CcAslButtnSetIncPress`) | `accelCruise` — creates or raises a HOLD | `resumeCruise` — engages and **keeps** the hold |
| `SET −` (`CcAslButtnSetDecPress`) | `decelCruise` — creates or lowers a HOLD | `setCruise` — engages, **clears** the hold, SLA takes the speed |
| `CNCL` (`CcAslButtnCnclResPress`) | `cancel` | also reports `resumeCruise`; harmless, resume is reachable from either |

The wheel is **CNCL / RES+ / SET−**, with CNCL as its own dedicated button — confirmed from a photo
on 2026-08-04. RES+ and SET− are single keys that change meaning with cruise state.

**Corrected 2026-08-04:** `CcAslButtnSetIncPress` previously emitted `setCruise` when cruise was
off, so every press of RES to resume reached openpilot as a SET — the one event that discards the
driver's hold. That is the original "holds are not remembered on resume" report, and the behavioural
detector (comparing the landed set speed against the pre-cancel value) had been compensating for a
mislabelled event rather than a missing one. The detector stays as belt-and-braces.
`test_button_mapping.py` guards the table.

A hold is also cleared by returning the set speed to exactly SLA's target, or by the posted limit
moving more than `IcbmBaselineResetDelta`. It is NOT cleared by curves or lead vehicles.

Two things that decided the design:

- **SET does not hold the current vehicle speed**, even though Ford's PCM briefly sets it there.
  If it did, every engagement would create a hold and SLA would never manage a limit unless the
  driver explicitly handed it back each drive. `+` is already the deliberate "I want a different
  number" gesture, so SET is left meaning "engage and manage it".
- **Tap moves the set speed 1 mph, press-and-hold moves it 5 mph** — the car's behavior, not
  openpilot's. Model set-speed movement as 5 mph jumps with stationary gaps, never a 1 mph ramp.

## Language and units — US

The owner is in the United States (Utah). Everything written here is **US English**: comments,
docstrings, commit messages, settings labels, alert text.

This was not being followed. A single pass on 2026-08-04 corrected 60 instances of *behaviour*,
*metres*, *colour*, *signalling*, *minimise*, *grey*, *dialled* and friends that had accumulated
across this branch. It reads as someone else's codebase, and upstream openpilot is US English
throughout, so the mixture is worse than either convention alone.

Units have a split that matters, and it is **not** a style choice:

- **Internally, SI.** Speeds are m/s, distances metres, accelerations m/s². That is openpilot's
  convention end to end and changing it would break every interface. Do not "fix" it.
- **Anything a driver reads, US customary.** mph, feet, miles. The conversion happens at the
  display boundary via `CV.MS_TO_MPH` and the `is_metric` param.
- **Comments describing driver-facing behavior should use mph**, even when the code beside them is
  in m/s — "below 6 mph" is the useful statement; "below 2.68 m/s" is not. Give both when the
  constant itself is SI.

Dates in comments: **ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`**. Not because it is US style — it is not — but because
`08-04` is genuinely ambiguous across readers and this file already records dated decisions.

## Car

2020 Ford Fusion Titanium AWD with retrofitted Edge ADAS parts (Edge PSCM, rack, IPMA camera, CCM
radar; Fusion ABS, IPC, steering column). Platform `FORD_FUSION_MK5`, `flags 18` =
`ALT_STEER_ANGLE | TSR`, **not** CAN FD — that combination is what exposed the duplicate-message
bug, so keep it in mind when reasoning about flag-gated branches.
